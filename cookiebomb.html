    <h2> Cookies Injected and User thrown out of their account and can not login anymore</h2><br>
    <p> Check your other tab, you must have been logged out !!</p>
<h2> The User can keep trying...no matter how hard you try to login, you will always be redirected back and stuck on the login page !!</h2><br><br>


<h1> !---- This is a small POC for Application Level DOS on BetterHelp !----</h1>
<h2> Now imagine the consequences if I chain it with an injection on a scoial media site like twitter, this can be easily escalated on mass scale 
  and lock mass audience out of their account</h2>
<h2>The only option to get back into your account is wiping your cookies BUT everytime you clear you cookies be ready for a frustrating 2FA :( </h2><br><br>
